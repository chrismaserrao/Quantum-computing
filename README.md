# Quantum-computing

##Lab 1
This lab consists of operation that represents Qubit states as |0> and |1> as Numpy Arrays, along with that 2 matrices M1 and M2 are defined, the average is computed for both of these. A matrix multiplication is carried using matmul from Numpy.
Then the Qiskit library is used, is represent states of superposition with the state vectors u and v, the braket notation is represented using LaTex, this is validated with the euclidean norm(total probability of the state =1 ).
A simulation is carried out, with the state of the vector between 0 and 1 for 1000 trials and plotted as a graph.
