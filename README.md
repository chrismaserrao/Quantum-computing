# Quantum-computing

## Lab 1
This lab consists of operation that represents Qubit states as |0> and |1> as Numpy Arrays, along with that 2 matrices M1 and M2 are defined, the average is computed for both of these. A matrix multiplication is carried using matmul from Numpy.

Then the Qiskit library is used, is represent states of superposition with the state vectors u and v, the braket notation is represented using LaTex, this is validated with the euclidean norm(total probability of the state =1 ).


A simulation is carried out, with the state of the vector between 0 and 1 for 1000 trials and plotted as a graph.

## Lab 2

Define a set of quantum gates, which are the operations performed on the vectors.
the vector is initialized to a state, a sequence of gates is set applied and the circuit is printed.
Finial count for the state of vectors is calculated.
Proof of Hadamard operation for r and s, R is the square root of NOT operation
